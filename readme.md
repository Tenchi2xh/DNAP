## Usage

### Download

Download and launch the application from the [releases](https://github.com/Tenchi2xh/DNAP/releases) page.

When using the standalone application, logs are written in `~/.dnap/dnap.log` instead of `stdout`.

### Run from source

Install dependencies using the requirements file relevant to your operating system:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements_macos.txt
```

To install the dependencies on Linux, [follow these instructions](readme_linux.md)

Run the application as a module:

```bash
python3 -m dnap
```

## Building

Common dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install requirements_[macos|windows].txt
pip3 install pyInstaller
```

### Mac

Just run `build_macos.sh`

### Windows

The [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) are required for some of the dependencies.

If you want an icon to be generated for the executable, you will need to install [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows). Install using the option `Install legacy utilities`.

Then, run `build_windows.bat`
